# Hi there 👋 I'm Gaurav Kumar

I enjoy building scalable backends, experimenting with GenAI workflows, and diving deep into systems programming with C++.

- 🔧 Currently working with **Go**, **PostgreSQL**, **Docker**, and **GCP**
- 📌 Projects include system software, GenAI-powered tools, and backend infrastructure
- 💡 Exploring: distributed systems, system software, GenAI and LLM-powered applications
